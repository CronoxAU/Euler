# Euler
My attempts at [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) problems

The intention of this work is to practice with and learn different languages, practice using Github and practice implementing and using unit testing. As such, while I do intend to implement reasonable, flexible, solutions, I am not seeking the mathematically optimum answer to each solution.
